# Installation

To install Snow, use this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/snow-labs/make-docs
```

Sometimes, you might have to do
```
npm install
```
Since this is a SvelteKit project, to run the dev server, use:
```
npm run dev
```
To build the project, you can try using the adapter-auto, but you can use other adapters as well, as long as they are compatible with SvelteKit.
